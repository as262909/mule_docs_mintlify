## Overview

DataWeave is MuleSoft's primary language for data transformation. It enables you to map, convert, and restructure data between formats like JSON, XML, CSV, and Java objects.

## Basic Syntax

A DataWeave script has two sections separated by `---`:

```dataweave
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
{
  name: payload.firstName ++ " " ++ payload.lastName,
  email: payload.email
}
```

## Supported Formats

| Format | MIME Type |
|--------|-----------|
| JSON | `application/json` |
| XML | `application/xml` |
| CSV | `application/csv` |
| Java | `application/java` |
| Flat File | `text/flatfile` |

## Common Operations

### Mapping

```dataweave
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
payload.items map {
  productName: $.name,
  totalPrice: $.price * $.quantity
}
```

### Filtering

```dataweave
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
payload.orders filter ($.amount > 100)
```

### Grouping

```dataweave
%dw 2.0
output application/json
---
payload.employees groupBy $.department
```

<Tip>
  Use the DataWeave Playground in Anypoint Studio to test transformations interactively.
