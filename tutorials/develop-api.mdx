description: "Build a Mule application from your API specification"
---

## Overview

With your API specification published to Exchange, you can now import it into Anypoint Studio to scaffold a fully functional Mule application. Studio generates the HTTP listener, routing logic, error handlers, and endpoint stubs automatically from your RAML definition.

---

## Step 3.1: Add Anypoint Platform Credentials to Studio

Before importing assets from Exchange, Studio needs your Anypoint Platform credentials.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Studio Preferences">
    In Anypoint Studio, navigate to **Anypoint Studio > Settings** (macOS) or **Window > Preferences** (Windows/Linux).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Authentication">
    Select **Anypoint Studio > Authentication** in the left panel. Enter your Anypoint Platform username and password, then click **Sign In**. Studio will validate your credentials and connect to your organization.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  If your organization uses external identity providers (SSO), use the **External Identity** option and follow your organization's SSO login flow.
</Tip>

## Step 3.2: Create a New Project from Exchange

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a new Mule project">
    Go to **File > New > Mule Project**. Enter the project name **hello-world-app**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import from Exchange">
    In the project creation wizard, check **Import a published API** and click the **From Exchange** button. Search for **hello-world-api** and select your published specification.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scaffold flows">
    Click **Finish**. Studio automatically generates the following components from your RAML:
  </Step>
</Steps>

Studio generates the following scaffolded components:

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **HTTP Listener** | Receives incoming HTTP requests on the configured host and port. |
| **APIkit Router** | Routes requests to the correct flow based on the resource path and HTTP method. |
| **Error Handlers** | Default error handling for common HTTP error codes (400, 404, 405, 406, 415, 501). |
| **GET /greeting flow** | A stub flow for the `GET /greeting` endpoint, ready for you to add business logic. |

---

## Step 3.3: Configure the API Logic

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the GET /greeting flow">
    In the Studio canvas, locate the **get:\greeting:hello-world-api-config** flow. This flow contains a default **Transform Message** component.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remove the Transform Message component">
    Select the **Transform Message** component and delete it. You will replace it with a simpler payload.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a Set Payload component">
    From the Mule Palette, drag a **Set Payload** component into the flow's process section. Configure it with the following value:

    ```
    Today the greeting is Hello.
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The Set Payload component directly assigns a static string to the message payload. For production APIs, you would typically use Transform Message with DataWeave to map data from databases, services, or other sources.
</Note>

## Step 3.4: Test Locally

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the application">
    Right-click the project in the Package Explorer and select **Run As > Mule Application**. Wait for the console to display **DEPLOYED** status.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send a test request">
    Open your REST client and send a **GET** request to:

    ```
    http://localhost:8081/api/greeting
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the response">
    Confirm that you receive a **200 OK** status code with the response body:

    ```
    Today the greeting is Hello.
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Canvas Views

Anypoint Studio provides three views of your Mule application:

| View | Description |
|---|---|
| **Message Flow** | Visual drag-and-drop canvas showing components and their connections. |
| **Global Elements** | Shared configuration elements (HTTP listener config, API autodiscovery, etc.). |
| **Configuration XML** | The underlying XML source of your Mule application for direct editing. |

### HTTP Listener Configuration

The scaffolded HTTP Listener uses the following default configuration:

```xml
<http:listener-config name="hello-world-api-httpListenerConfig">
  <http:listener-connection host="0.0.0.0" port="8081" />
</http:listener-config>

<http:listener config-ref="hello-world-api-httpListenerConfig" path="/api/*" />
```

| Property | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `host` | `0.0.0.0` | Listens on all network interfaces. |
| `port` | `8081` | Default HTTP port for Mule applications. |
| `path` | `/api/*` | Base path prefix; all resources are served under `/api`. |

## Step 3.5: Create a Business Group for Exchange Publishing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Access Management">
    In Anypoint Platform, go to **Access Management > Business Groups**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new Business Group">
    Click **Create Business Group** and provide a name that reflects your team or project. Business groups control asset visibility and access on Exchange.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 3.6: Publish to Exchange

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the publish wizard">
    In Anypoint Studio, right-click your project and select **Anypoint Platform > Publish to Exchange**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure asset details">
    Set the asset type to **Example**. Confirm the project name, version, and target business group.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish">
    Click **Finish** to publish your Mule application to Exchange. Other developers in your organization can now discover and import this example project.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Ensure your project compiles and runs successfully before publishing. Exchange does not validate the runtime behavior of published assets -- only the packaging and metadata.
</Warning>
