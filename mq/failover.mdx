title: "Cross-Region Failover"
description: "Configure automatic failover to a backup region for standard queues"
---

## Overview

Cross-region failover provides automatic switching to a backup region when the primary region becomes unreachable. When enabled, Anypoint MQ creates a **fallback queue** (with a `_fb` suffix) in a designated backup region to ensure message continuity.

<Note>
Cross-region failover provides **resiliency**, not **redundancy**. Messages are not replicated between regions. Failover ensures your applications can continue sending and receiving messages during a regional outage, but messages already in the primary queue remain there until the region recovers.
</Note>

## How Failover Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Health Monitoring">
    The Anypoint MQ connector continuously monitors the health of the primary region by sending periodic health-check requests.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Switchover">
    When the primary region becomes unreachable, the connector automatically redirects message operations to the fallback queue in the backup region.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Primary Restoration">
    The connector continues to monitor the primary region. When it becomes available again, the connector switches back automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fallback Message Processing">
    After switching back to the primary region, the connector **processes remaining messages in the fallback queue first** before resuming consumption from the primary queue.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Limitations

<Warning>
Review these limitations carefully before enabling cross-region failover.
</Warning>

| Limitation | Details |
|---|---|
| Not enabled by default | Failover must be explicitly enabled per queue. |
| Connector version | Requires **Anypoint MQ Connector 4.0.7** or later. |
| Standard queues only | FIFO queues and message exchanges are **not supported**. |
| No data replication | Messages are not replicated between primary and fallback regions. |
| Gov Cloud | Cross-region failover is **not supported** in Gov Cloud. |
| UI limitations | The **Message Sender** and **Message Browser** in the MQ console do not support failover operations. |
| API request consumption | Periodic health-check calls to primary and fallback regions consume additional API requests. |

## Configuring Failover

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Queue Settings">
    Open the Anypoint MQ console, select the target queue, and click **Edit** (or create a new queue).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Cross-Region Failover">
    Toggle **Enable Cross-Region Failover** to on. The system automatically assigns a fallback region and creates the fallback queue with the `_fb` suffix.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Configuration">
    Save the queue configuration. The fallback queue appears in your destinations list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart Applications">
    Restart all Mule applications that consume from or publish to this queue. The connector must reinitialize to detect the failover configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
After enabling failover, verify the fallback queue was created by checking the destinations list for a queue named `<your-queue>_fb`.
</Tip>

## Regional Mapping

When failover is enabled, MQ maps the primary region to a designated fallback region. The following table shows the mapping across supported regions.

| Primary Region | Fallback Region |
|---|---|
| US East (N. Virginia) | US East (Ohio) |
| US East (Ohio) | US East (N. Virginia) |
| US West (Oregon) | US East (N. Virginia) |
| Canada (Central) | US East (N. Virginia) |
| EU (Frankfurt) | EU (Ireland) |
| EU (Ireland) | EU (Frankfurt) |
| Asia Pacific (Singapore) | Asia Pacific (Sydney) |
| Asia Pacific (Sydney) | Asia Pacific (Singapore) |
| Asia Pacific (Tokyo) | Asia Pacific (Singapore) |

<Info>
Fallback region assignments are fixed and cannot be customized. The mapping is designed to minimize latency while providing geographic separation.
