## API-Led Connectivity

MuleSoft promotes an API-led approach to integration with three layers:

- **System APIs** - Unlock data from core systems (ERP, CRM, databases)
- **Process APIs** - Orchestrate business logic across multiple systems
- **Experience APIs** - Deliver data tailored for specific channels (web, mobile, IoT)

## Benefits

- **Reusability** - Build APIs once and reuse them across projects
- **Speed** - Accelerate integration development with pre-built connectors
- **Scalability** - Deploy on CloudHub, on-premises, or hybrid environments
- **Governance** - Centrally manage and secure all your APIs
