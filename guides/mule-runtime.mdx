## Overview

Mule runtime engine is the lightweight, Java-based integration engine that processes messages through your Mule applications. It is the core of the Anypoint Platform, responsible for executing your integration logic.

## Key Capabilities

- **Message processing** - Route, transform, and enrich messages between systems
- **Connectivity** - Use connectors to integrate with hundreds of systems and protocols
- **Error handling** - Built-in error handling with try/catch scopes and error types
- **Transactions** - Support for transactional processing across multiple systems
- **Clustering** - Deploy in clusters for high availability and load balancing

## Deployment Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **CloudHub** | MuleSoft-hosted cloud runtime |
| **Runtime Fabric** | Self-hosted on Kubernetes |
| **On-Premises** | Standalone Mule runtime on your servers |
| **Anypoint Studio** | Embedded runtime for local development and testing |

## Architecture

Mule applications consist of **flows** that define how messages are processed:

- **Source** - Triggers the flow (e.g., HTTP Listener, Scheduler)
- **Processors** - Transform, route, or enrich the message
- **Error Handler** - Catches and handles errors in the flow
