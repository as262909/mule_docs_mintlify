## Authentication

Every API request to the Anypoint Platform requires a valid bearer token in the `Authorization` header. There are two primary ways to obtain a token.

### Option 1 -- Username and Password

Use the `/accounts/login` endpoint to exchange your Anypoint Platform credentials for a bearer token.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request a token">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "username": "your-username",
        "password": "your-password"
      }'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract the access_token from the response">
    ```json
    {
      "access_token": "e5d7f8a0-b345-4c12-9a0f-1234abcd5678",
      "token_type": "bearer"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the token in subsequent requests">
    ```bash
    curl https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/repository/v2/organizations/{orgId}/apis \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer e5d7f8a0-b345-4c12-9a0f-1234abcd5678"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Option 2 -- Connected Apps (Client Credentials)

For automated pipelines and service-to-service integrations, use a Connected App configured with the **client_credentials** grant type.

```bash
curl -X POST https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/api/v2/oauth2/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID" \
  -d "client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "access_token": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

<Tip>
  Connected Apps tokens are scoped. Make sure the Connected App has the required scopes for the APIs you intend to call (e.g., **API Manager**, **Runtime Manager**, **Exchange**).
</Tip>

### Using the Bearer Token

Include the token in the `Authorization` header of every API request:

```
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
```

<Note>
  **Federated authentication:** If your organization uses an external identity provider (SSO), you cannot use the `/accounts/login` endpoint directly. Instead, authenticate through your IdP and exchange the resulting SAML assertion for an Anypoint token via `POST /accounts/api/v2/auth/exchangeToken`. Refer to the [Anypoint Access Management documentation](https://docs.mulesoft.com/access-management/) for details.
</Note>

### Token Lifetime

| Method | Default Expiry | Refresh |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| Username / password | 60 minutes | Re-authenticate with `/accounts/login` |
| Connected App (client_credentials) | 60 minutes | Request a new token with the same client credentials |

<Warning>
  Never embed credentials or tokens in source code repositories. Use environment variables or a secrets manager in CI/CD pipelines.
</Warning>
