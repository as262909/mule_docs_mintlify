## API Requests

Every API call to Anypoint MQ counts as one billable request. This includes all operations performed through the MQ connector, REST APIs, and the Anypoint Platform UI.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Billable Operations" icon="receipt">
    - Sending a message
    - Receiving a message
    - Acknowledging a message
    - Queue and exchange operations (create, modify, delete)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Non-Billable Operations" icon="circle-check">
    - Stats API requests
    - Messages routed to a dead letter queue (DLQ)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
A single API call that returns up to 10 messages (such as a batch receive) is billed as **one request**, not one per message. Use batch operations where possible to optimize API request usage.
</Tip>

## Message Units

<Note>
Message units are not used for billing. They measure the response data size for monitoring purposes. Each message unit represents **100 KB** of response data.
</Note>

A single message larger than 100 KB consumes multiple message units. For example, a 250 KB message consumes 3 message units.

## Failover Impact on Usage

<Warning>
If cross-region failover is configured, periodic health-check calls to the primary and fallback regions consume additional API requests. Factor this into your usage estimates when enabling failover on queues.
</Warning>
