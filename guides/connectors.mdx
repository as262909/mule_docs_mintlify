## Overview

MuleSoft connectors provide pre-built connectivity to hundreds of systems, protocols, and SaaS applications. They handle authentication, data serialization, and error management so you can focus on integration logic.

## Popular Connectors

| Connector | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| **HTTP/HTTPS** | REST API calls and webhooks |
| **Database** | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server |
| **Salesforce** | CRM data synchronization |
| **SAP** | ERP integration |
| **File/SFTP** | File-based integrations |
| **JMS / Anypoint MQ** | Asynchronous messaging |
| **Email** | SMTP, IMAP, POP3 |
| **Amazon S3** | Cloud storage |

## Finding Connectors

Connectors are available through:

- **Anypoint Exchange** - Browse and install connectors from the marketplace
- **Mule Palette** - Search and add connectors directly in Anypoint Studio
- **Maven** - Add connector dependencies to your `pom.xml`

## Connector Configuration

Each connector requires a **connection configuration** that defines how to connect to the target system. Configurations typically include:

- **Connection URL or host**
- **Authentication credentials**
- **Connection pooling settings**
- **Timeout values**

<Tip>
  Create global connector configurations that can be reused across multiple flows in your application.
