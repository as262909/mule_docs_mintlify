## Security and Encryption

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does Anypoint MQ secure messages in transit?">
    All communication with Anypoint MQ uses **HTTPS with TLS 1.2**. This applies to the MQ connector, REST APIs, and the Anypoint Platform console.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does Anypoint MQ encrypt messages at rest?">
    Encryption at rest is **optional** and can be enabled per queue. When enabled, messages are encrypted using **AES-256 GCM**.

    <Warning>
    Encryption at rest applies to the **message body only**. Message headers and properties are **not encrypted**. Do not store sensitive data in message headers or properties.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Messages and Queues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the maximum message size?">
    The maximum message size is **10 MB**. Messages exceeding this limit are rejected by the API.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How many messages can be in-flight at once?">
    - **Standard queues**: Up to **120,000** in-flight messages.
    - **FIFO queues**: Up to **10 in-flight messages per message group**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are messages delivered in order?">
    - **Standard queues**: No order guarantee. Messages may be delivered in any order.
    - **FIFO queues**: Messages within the same message group are delivered in **strict first-in, first-out order**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the maximum batch size?">
    A single API call can send or receive up to **10 messages** in a batch.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How long are messages retained?">
    Messages are retained for up to **2 weeks** (14 days). You can configure a shorter TTL (time-to-live) per queue or per message.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance and Throughput

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the throughput limit for standard queues?">
    Standard queues have **no maximum TPS (transactions per second) limit**. Throughput scales with the number of concurrent consumers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the throughput limit for FIFO queues?">
    FIFO queues support up to **300 TPS** per queue. With batching (up to 10 messages per request), effective throughput can reach **3,000 messages per second**.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Delivery Guarantees

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What delivery guarantee does Anypoint MQ provide?">
    - **Standard queues**: **At-least-once delivery**. A message may be delivered more than once in rare cases. Design your consumers to handle duplicate messages.
    - **FIFO queues**: Support **exactly-once delivery** with automatic deduplication. Duplicate messages sent within the deduplication interval are discarded.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## High Availability

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is Anypoint MQ highly available?">
    Yes. Anypoint MQ is deployed across **multiple Availability Zones (multi-AZ)** within each region for high availability. Messages are retained during outages and become available when the service recovers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does Anypoint MQ support cross-region failover?">
    Yes, for **standard queues only**. Cross-region failover can be enabled per queue to automatically switch to a fallback queue in a backup region when the primary region is unreachable. See the [Cross-Region Failover](/mq/failover) documentation for details.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## API and Integration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How are API requests counted for billing?">
    Every API call counts as **one billable request**, regardless of the number of messages returned. A batch receive returning up to 10 messages counts as a single request.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use Anypoint MQ from non-Mule applications?">
    Yes. Use the Anypoint MQ **REST APIs** (Admin, Broker, and Stats) to integrate with any application that can make HTTP requests. See the [REST APIs](/mq/apis) documentation for details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does Anypoint MQ support batch operations?">
    Yes. The **Broker API** supports batch publish and batch consume of up to 10 messages per request.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Known Limitations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I configure retry strategies with the MQ connector?">
    No. The Anypoint MQ connector does **not support Mule retry strategies** (such as `reconnect` or `reconnect-forever`). Implement retry logic at the application level if needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is there a built-in way to replay messages from a dead letter queue?">
    No. There is **no built-in DLQ replay mechanism**. To reprocess DLQ messages, you must consume them from the DLQ and republish them to the original queue programmatically.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I share messages across regions?">
    No. There is **no cross-region message sharing or replication**. Each queue exists in a single region. Cross-region failover creates a separate fallback queue but does not replicate messages.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I deploy Anypoint MQ on premises?">
    No. Anypoint MQ is a **cloud-only service**. There is no on-premises deployment option.
  </Accordion>
