## Overview

API-led connectivity enables delightful digital experiences by organizing your integrations into layers of reusable, purpose-built APIs. At their core, APIs are digital messengers that carry requests and responses between applications, allowing systems to communicate without knowing the details of each other's implementation.

This tutorial walks you through the full lifecycle of building, deploying, and operating an API using MuleSoft's Anypoint Platform. By the end, you will have a working API running in the cloud with validation, error handling, a proxy gateway, and rate limiting in place.

<Note>
  No prior MuleSoft experience is required. Each step builds on the previous one, so follow them in order for the best learning experience.

## The 6-Step Journey

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prerequisites and Initial Setup">
    Ensure you have access to Anypoint Platform, Anypoint Studio installed locally, and a REST client (such as Advanced REST Client or Postman) for testing your API endpoints.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Design an API Specification">
    Create a RAML specification that defines your API's resources, methods, request/response schemas, and example payloads. Test it against a mocking service and publish it to Exchange.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Develop the API">
    Import your published specification into Anypoint Studio to scaffold a Mule application. Configure the logic behind each endpoint, test locally, and publish your application to Exchange.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Validation and Error Handling">
    Strengthen your API by adding input validation rules and custom error handlers. Use the Studio debugger to step through your flows and verify behavior.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy to CloudHub">
    Deploy your Mule application to CloudHub, create an API proxy in API Manager, and apply a rate-limiting policy to protect your API from excessive traffic.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Operate the API">
    Monitor your running API using Runtime Manager. Review logs, traffic data, and performance metrics to keep your API healthy in production.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Use the API-led connectivity model to plan your own projects. Organize APIs into three layers -- **Experience APIs** (user-facing), **Process APIs** (orchestration logic), and **System APIs** (back-end connectors) -- to build a composable, reusable integration architecture.
